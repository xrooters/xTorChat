 xTorChat is a free  messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to an existing account, create new accounts on public XMPP server “xrooters.ro” (including via Tor),  for extra security.
 Unlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, xTorChat is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR , OMEMO and XMPP.
 xTorChat only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.
* XMPP with TLS certificate .
* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.
* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.
* Tor integration for extra security.
* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.
